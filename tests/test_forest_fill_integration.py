"""
Integration tests for forest fill algorithm using real hole data.

These tests use hole_18_with_placeholders.json which is UK hole 18
with a large placeholder region (199 tiles) for testing the forest fill algorithm.

CURRENT STATUS: FAILING - Algorithm only fills 77/199 tiles successfully.
The issue appears to be with neighbor constraint matching - many cells
report "No valid tile found" even though valid forest tiles should exist.

"""
DEBUGGING NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:

The forest fill algorithm is partially working but has a critical bug in _get_valid_tiles().

Symptoms:
- Region detection works perfectly (finds 199 placeholder tiles in 1 region)
- Distance field calculation works (distances range from 1 to 15)
- Only 77/199 tiles get filled successfully
- 122 tiles report "No valid tile found"

Test case to reproduce:
- Load: tests/fixtures/hole_18_with_placeholders.json
- Failing cell example: (3, 13) with down neighbor 0x94 (148)

Key issue:
The neighbor validator uses decimal string keys like "148" not hex like "0x94".
This was partially fixed but the algorithm still fails to find valid tiles.

Next debugging steps:
1. Verify neighbor validator keys are correct format (str(tile_value))
2. Check if forest tiles (0xA0-0xBB) exist in neighbor validator data
3. Manually test: can any forest tile have 0x94 as a down neighbor?
4. Print debug info for one failing cell to see what valid_in_direction contains

The fix is likely in how we're querying the validator's neighbor relationships.
