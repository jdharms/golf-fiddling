* rows must be even
* scroll limit is calculable
* edit metadata
* Grid lines should be supertiles when in palette mode
* ~~drag to transform up/left?~~
* Invalid neighbor indicator should be a single border per pairing
* Investigate different green slopes, especially unused.
* Distance measurement!
* Wooden signs?
* Scorecard course name?
* "toolbox"/mode selection? (i.e., fill, rectangle, more?)
* Does SuperShot! do anything?

Thoughts:
* It can be tough to know when to "cut bait"
* I have a temptation to fix problems at the abstraction level I'm working at (claude code), even when fixing the problem is just a few changes to a few lines in a few files.
