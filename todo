* rows must be even
* scroll limit is calculable
* edit metadata
* Grid lines should be supertiles when in palette mode
* ~~drag to transform up/left?~~
* Invalid neighbor indicator should be a single border per pairing
* Wooden signs?
* Scorecard course name?
* Does SuperShot! do anything?

Tool ideas:
* Rectangle?
* Border fill?

* I keep finding myself wanting clicking on the picker to switch directly to the paint tool

Thoughts:
* It can be tough to know when to "cut bait"
* I have a temptation to fix problems at the abstraction level I'm working at (claude code), even when fixing the problem is just a few changes to a few lines in a few files.
