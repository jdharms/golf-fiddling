Investigate:
* Wooden signs?
* Scorecard course name?


Non-editor:
* "missed" shots
* Does SuperShot! do anything?


Todos:
* Invalid neighbor indicator should be a single border per pairing
* Add lie chart to rangefinder
* Add greens to rangefinder?
* F1 through F4 keys should send us to flag 1 through flag 4
* Greens writeup
* release bundling
* Fringe gen logging upon failure


Bugs:
* The status bar text seems vaguely wrong--needs investigation later.


Thoughts:
* It can be tough to know when to "cut bait"
* I have a temptation to fix problems at the abstraction level I'm working at (claude code), even when fixing the problem is just a few changes to a few lines in a few files.


Done:
* rows must be even
* scroll limit is calculable
* Forest border tiles are "subset" of fill tiles--can we exploit this? YES WE CAN!
* Metadata tool should send you back to previous tool or paint tool
* Measurement tool should show sum in status bar
* Movement tool sprite highlighting is kinda bizarre -- why is it 2x2 tiles
* Movement tool could benefit from held arrow keys registering.
* Movement tool maybe should only allow moving tee, green on terrain and flags on green?
* Movement tool should automatically switch the flag being displayed!
* clean up unnecessary "sprites" button and remove ability for sprite visibility to be toggled
* Palette tile crashes on out of range paint
* clean up status bar a bit
* Greens compression is extremely messed up?
* Sub-bank fringe tiles according to classifications
* missing fringe tiles
* Green rough fill, green putting surface fill
* Carpet tool semantics wrt editor state
  * Clicking a picker tile should keep us in Carpet
  * What should clicking into terrain mode do? Paint?
  * Status bar could probably help a little
* Remove "Flag n/4" from status bar
* scroll state should be separate for terrain and green if possible
* Greens stats
* Create stamp library
* G should cycle through grid sizes, alter palette tool?
